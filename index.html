            <h1>Chico Rasia: Creative Problem Solver</h1>
            <p>Where Architecture Meets Tech Passion.</p>


            <h3>Hello, I'm Chico Rasia. Architect. Tech Enthusiast.</h3>
            <p>My journey marries the precision of architecture with a fervent passion for software development.
              As an architect by trade and a self-taught software developer,
              I bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to each endeavor.</p>

            <h3>Bridging Public and Private Sectors.</h3>
            <p>With extensive experience across both public and private sectors, I navigate the intricate intersections
              of technology, society and politics, seeking to innovate and bring meaningful solutions to the forefront.</p>

            <h3>Education as a Foundation:</h3>
            <p>I hold a Master's degree in Technology and Society, complemented by an MBA specializing in the Management
              of IT&C services, offering a diverse skill set that shapes my approach to every project.</p>

            <h3>Portfolio Showcasing Versatility: Android, Kotlin, Java, Python.</h3>
            <p>Dive into my curated portfolio spanning Android, Kotlin, Java, and Python projects,
              where technical proficiency meets a blend of soft skills honed through architecture.
              These creations reflect not only a mastery of languages but also the application
              of critical thinking, problem-solving, and design principles.</p>

            <h3>Technical Expertise in Multiple Languages:</h3>
            <p>Explore my projects developed in Android, Kotlin, Java, and Python,
            illustrating a depth of technical knowledge and adaptability across
